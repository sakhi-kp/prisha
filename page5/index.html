            <p>I just want to say sorry — not just from me, but also from Krrish 🙏💔. We both know a lot was said that day… words that hurt you deeply 🥺. And honestly, that was my mistake. I take full responsibility 😔.</p>
            <p>Krrish was already upset, and I made it worse by taking out all the anger on you 😞. He never meant to hurt you, not even for a second 💭. Since then, he hasn't been able to forgive himself — and maybe never will 😢.</p>
            <p class="sister-note">So please, forgive him 💖. Forgive me 🙇‍♂️. I know we haven't spoken in days, and that hurts even more 💬💔. If you're still angry, be angry with me — but please, talk to him again 🙏. All of this… was my fault ❤️.</p>
